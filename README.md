## Score Tracker

You have been approached by a local sports (rugby) team to develop an app that  members of their management staff can use at the side of the pitch to keep a track of the score during the game as well as the time left on the clock.

## MVP
A user should be able to:
	• Input the respective team names.
	• Start/Stop the clock to view time in the game
	• Add a score to a specific team

The app shouldn't require a backend at this stage as everything is possible in browser.

## Extensions
This is the first step of DB inclusion, single table/simple API
A user could be able to:
	• Select a specific sport that alters the scoring system displayed.
	• Generate a tweet to send out from the app to update their social media page.
	• Store previous results.

Further Extensions
This represents the implementation of a PostgreSQL backend to store/generate a Sport Rules API
A user might want to:
Input their own custom sport where they can define: Playing time, playing periods and scoring system.
